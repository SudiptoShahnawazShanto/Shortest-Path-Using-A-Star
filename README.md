# ShortestPathUsingA-Star

Heuristics are used in this project to determine the shortest amount of time to travel between two locations.
The quickest route between the source and the destination will be displayed by the project. The main objective
of this project is to minimize the amount of time required to go between two locations where there are various
possibilities but one requires the route with the fewest obstacles and least amount of travel time.
